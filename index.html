<p>I am a student at PIA, and so far I am just working to improve my education and make my family and supervisors proud, while balancing it with some time set aside for gaming and reading. I don't have any specific or unique hobbies or interests, though I do have a slightly above average interest for art/drawing.</p>
<p>My favorite color is</p> <p style="color:purple;">purple.</p>
<p>My favorite school subject would be English since I am most used to it and I tend to stick to my comfort zone more often than not, though I can also bring myself to enjoy other subjects when I properly understand the work. <a href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> is a language teaching site or app if you want, that I also find intriguing when it comes to learning.</p>
